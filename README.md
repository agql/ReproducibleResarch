# Reproducible Resarch
This is a repository that I have created to include the assigments from Reproducible Research Data Science specialisation.

So far, there are two exercises:
* Research carried out on activity monitoring information automatically gathered using devices - Fitbit like. Two files "PA1_template" + activity.csv with the data that is used.
* Research carried out on impact from severe weather conditions at USA between 1950 and 2011

You are free to use, copy and reproduce. Naming the source will be appreciated.
