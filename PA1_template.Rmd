This project is based on a dataset containing activity monitoring information automatically gathered using devices - Fitbit like. 

The dataset contains the following fields

* Steps: Number of steps in the interval, missing values coded as NA
* Date: factor with the date of the measure, YYYY-MM-DD format.
* Interval: Five minutes interval represented as (0, 5, ..., 155, 200, ... ,2355), where 0 represents the interval from 00:00 to 00:05 hours, 135 the interval from 01:35 to 01:40 and 2355 is the last interval representing from 23:55 to 00:00 the next day.

##Loading and Preprocesing data

Data is loaded using 

```{r}
myData <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

##Results agregated per day

Data is aggregated by each day of measure.

```{r}
mySumData <- aggregate( steps ~ date, data = myData, FUN = sum)
```

We have created a new dataframe with only one record per day, this is, the **total steps for each day**. Now we display graphically the results using an histogram

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mySumData, aes(steps)) +
     geom_histogram(bins = 53) +
     labs(x="Steps", y="Number of days") + 
     labs(title=expression("Activity distribution"))
```

This histogram represents the distribution of steps taken. So there are few days with no activity and most of the days about 10.000 steps are registered.

If we want to see now many steps have been taken each day, we propose the following bar chart (Not requested by the exercise)

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mySumData, aes(factor(date), steps)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity",fill="darkblue",width=0.75) +
  theme_bw() +  guides(fill=FALSE) +
  labs(x="Dates", y="Steps") + 
  labs(title=expression("Steps per day (2012)"))
```

To provide additional information, we calculate the mean and median per day

Mean:
```{r}
mean(mySumData$steps)
```

Median:
```{r}
median(mySumData$steps)
```

##Research on daily patterns

To further investigate we split the data into a dataframe that contains the average of steps that are taken at each by interval. This way we can compare if more steps are taken in the morning, afternoon, etc.

```{r}
myAvgData <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data = myData, FUN = mean)
```

Not surprisingly, this data feame has 288 observations as 288 is the number of 5 minutes periods in 1 day. We represent graphically this information

```{r}
ggplot(myAvgData, aes(interval, steps)) +
     geom_line() +
     labs(x="5 mins. interval", y="Steps") + 
     labs(title=expression("Steps per interval"))
```

We can also identify the period where more steps are taken

```{r}
maxInterval <- myAvgData[max(myAvgData$steps) == myAvgData$steps,]
maxInterval$interval
```

This result should correspond with the information shown on the time series plot above. In our example, this correspond to 8:35 in the morning, a typical commute time.

## Imputing missing values

In our original data there are a number of days/intervals where there are missing values (coded as NA). If coding of missing values is different we may need a pre-processing.

The total number of rows with missing values is:

```{r}
nrow(myData[is.na(myData$steps),])
```

We will replace those missing values with the mean of the value for that interval.

For that purpose, we write a function that accepts as parameters the data frame to be cleaned and the dataframe that contains the average values for each period

````{r}
CleanNA <- function(df, avgDf) {
  for(i in 1:nrow(df)) {
    if (is.na(df[i,]$steps)) {
      j <- df[i,]$interval
      df[i,]$steps <- avgDf[avgDf$interval == j,]$steps
    }
  }
  df
}
```

Using this function we create the new dataframe with no "NA" values.

````{r}
cleanData <- CleanNA(myData, myAvgData)
```

Now, in order to compare with the initial data, we reproduce the histogram and the calculations 

````{r}
myCleanSumData <- aggregate( steps ~ date, data = cleanData, FUN = sum)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(myCleanSumData, aes(steps)) +
     geom_histogram(bins = 53) +
     labs(x="Steps", y="Number of days") + 
     labs(title=expression("Activity distribution"))
```

Mean:
```{r}
mean(myCleanSumData$steps)
```

Median:
```{r}
median(myCleanSumData$steps)
```


##Activity patterns in weekdays vs weekends

Finally, for this study We will compare activity in in weekdays vs weekends. For that we will create a new factor variable in the dataset

For that purpose, we first find out the day of the week for each date:

````{r}
wdnames <- weekdays(as.Date(myData$date))
```

But days' names are not very useful. In particular, they are language dependent (as in our example that they are in Spanish - Note, we have not changes the language settings intentionally to show this potential problem). Therefore, we create an array stating with TRUE or FALSE if the day is weekend or not.

````{r}
weTorF = sapply(wdnames, function (x) {x == "sábado" || x == "domingo"} )
```

Note: For other languages, substitute "sábado" by "saturday", or its equivalent, and "domingo" by "sunday"

Now we add this array as a new collumn to our data frame

````{r}
myData[,"isWeekend"] <- weTorF
```

We create two dataframes, one for each type of day

````{r}
myDataWeekDay <- myData[myData$isWeekend==FALSE, ] 
myDataWeekEnd <- myData[myData$isWeekend==TRUE, ]
```

And we compute again the average per period of the day

````{r}
myAvgDataWd <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data = myDataWeekDay, FUN = mean)
myAvgDataWe <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data = myDataWeekEnd, FUN = mean)
```

The next step is to create a single data frame from these, but with an additional variable that indicates the type of day

```{r}
myAvgDataWd[, "type"] <- "Weekday"
myAvgDataWe[, "type"] <- "Weekend"
myAvgDataDays <- rbind(myAvgDataWd, myAvgDataWe)
```


````{r}
ggplot(myAvgDataDays, aes(x=interval, y=steps)) + 
       geom_line(color = "darkblue") + 
       facet_wrap(~ type, nrow=2, ncol=1) +
       labs(x="Interval", y="Number of steps") +
       theme_bw()
```

In our study, activity during weekends starts later and it is more homogenous. During weekdays is particularly high at commute slot of the day.
